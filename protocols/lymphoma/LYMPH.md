## INTRODUCTION 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) refers to a diverse group of lymphoid malignancies with varied clinical presentations. The malignant cells of NHL can be derived from B cell progenitors, T cell progenitors, mature B cells, or mature T cells.

Most cases of pediatric NHL exhibit high-grade pathology and aggressive clinical behavior, in contrast to NHL in adults, where low-grade, clinically indolent NHL subtypes are common. Management of pediatric NHL varies according to the lymphoma subtype, disease stage, and other clinical and prognostic features.
NHL is the fifth most common diagnosis of pediatric cancer in children <15 years.

NHL accounts for approximately 7 percent of childhood cancers in resource-abundant countries [1]. In the United States, approximately 800 new cases of pediatric NHL are diagnosed annually, with an incidence of 10 to 20 cases per million people per year. The incidence appears to be increasing overall, reflecting a rise in NHL among adolescents.
The median age at diagnosis is 10 years, and the incidence increases with age. Lymphomas are rare in infants (≤1 percent of cancers), accounting for approximately 4, 14, 22, and 25 percent of neoplasms in children 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 to 19 years, respectively. There is a male predominance, and white children are more commonly affected than African American children.

The incidence and distribution of specific NHL subtypes differ by population and geographical region. Generally, the most common subtypes of pediatric NHL are derived from B cell progenitors. The most common subtypes in resource-abundant countries are Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic T cell or B cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Other subtypes (eg, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma) are less common, accounting for approximately 7 percent of pediatric NHL.


## CLINICAL PRESENTATION
### Oncologic emergencies
Emergency complications may be present at diagnosis and should be considered during the initial workup and evaluation of a child with suspected pediatric NHL. Oncologic emergencies may be life threatening or they can interfere with or delay treatment of the underlying NHL. Prompt recognition and management are critical for these situations.
As an example, large mediastinal masses at presentation increase the risk of respiratory or cardiac arrest during general anesthesia or heavy sedation and increase the risk of perioperative morbidity. Potential oncologic emergencies and their management are discussed separately:
- Acute airway obstruction 
- Superior or inferior vena cava obstruction 
- Cardiac tamponade
- Intestinal obstruction, intussusception 
- Spinal cord compression 
- Lymphomatous meningitis and central nervous system (CNS) mass lesions 
- Hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) 
- Ureteral obstruction, unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis 
- Venous thromboembolic disease 

### Clinical manifestations
The clinical presentation of pediatric NHL varies with the type of lymphoma and sites of involvement.
Symptoms generally develop over one to three weeks. Common presentations include enlarging, nontender lymphadenopathy, or symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures (eg, wheezing, facial swelling, respiratory distress, asymmetrical tonsils, acute abdominal pain).
Some patients have unexplained fever, weight loss, or night sweats (ie, "B symptoms"). Thromboemboli and metabolic complications (eg, TLS) can occur, and liver and/or spleen enlargement may be seen in patients with advanced NHL. CNS involvement occurs in 6 percent of pediatric NHL, with rates ranging from 8.8 percent in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) to <3 percent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [6].
While certain clinical presentations may suggest specific types of NHL, diagnosis requires a biopsy of involved tissue, as described below. (See 'Diagnosis' below.)
Laboratory findings — Laboratory tests are often abnormal at presentation.
- Hematology – Blood counts may be normal. However, unexplained anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia can be caused by extensive bone marrow infiltration, hypersplenism from splenic involvement, or blood loss from gastrointestinal tract involvement
- Hyperuricemia – Elevated uric acid, potassium, and diminished kidney function are most often seen with rapidly proliferating tumors, such as BL or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).
Hyperuricemia and/or TLS may be exacerbated by underlying kidney dysfunction due to either renal infiltration with lymphoma, pre-existing renal disease, or coincident obstruction of the ureters secondary to NHL. 
- Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) – Serum LDH may be elevated in patients with a high tumor burden and/or extensive infiltration of the liver, especially with BL, LBL, or other rapidly proliferative tumors. Elevated LDH (especially if >2 to 3 times normal) is associated with an adverse prognosis.

### Imaging
Imaging is important for evaluating findings at presentation and is required for disease staging.

Initial evaluation – Ultrasonography, radiographs, and/or computed tomography (CT) are often used to evaluate presenting symptoms, such as enlarged lymph nodes, respiratory symptoms, or abdominal pain. These studies may demonstrate masses and/or lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, or abdomen.

Evaluation of bone pain may involve imaging with bone radiography, CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bone lesions in NHL are mostly osteolytic on plain films, in contrast to predominantly osteoblastic bone lesions associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.
Imaging is important for investigating neurologic abnormalities. Brain MRI, with and without gadolinium, may identify CNS abnormalities in children with neurologic symptoms or signs. If spinal cord compression is suspected, urgent MRI of the entire spinal column should be performed, since there may be multiple sites of involvement.


## DIAGNOSIS
NHL should be suspected in a child or adolescent with unexplained lymphadenopathy, an abdominal or other mass, or constitutional symptoms. Pediatricians and other clinicians should promptly refer a patient with a suspected NHL to a pediatric oncologist for evaluation and diagnosis.

Diagnosis of NHL requires pathologic evaluation of involved tissue (eg, lymph node, abdominal mass, extranodal site) interpreted within the clinical context. NHL subtypes are defined by histology, immunophenotype, and genetic studies. 
Diagnosis and classification should be based on either the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms [9] or the World Health Organization 5th edition (WHO5). Either system is acceptable, and they have superseded earlier diagnosis and classification schemes. 

**Differential diagnosis** — Various malignant, infectious, and inflammatory diseases can present with findings that resemble those of pediatric NHL. Disorders in the differential diagnosis of pediatric NHL must be distinguished by clinical evaluation, imaging, and/or biopsy.

Examples of disorders that must be distinguished from NHL include Hodgkin lymphoma, adenopathy from other primary tumors (eg, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma), appendicitis, intussusception, toxoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections, EBV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, and reactive hyperplasia of lymph nodes. Note that a lymphoma-associated anterior mediastinal mass must be distinguished from normal thymus (which attains maximal size around age 10 years), and in contrast with Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL may manifest noncontiguous areas of involvement.


## STAGING FOR DIAGNOSIS

Routine staging studies:
- Ultrasonography, computed tomography sites, and skeletal scintigraphy
- Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, with or without contrast-enhanced CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis
- Bilateral iliac crest bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Cytogenetics of bone marrow aspirate and/or lymph node
- Lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid, 
- Brain MRI for patients with Burkitt lymphoma
- PET scan to be done at diagnosis and after COPADM1 to determine complete response (CR) rate. Rate

Supportive investigations: 
- 2D echo heart at diagnosis, and at cumulative dose of 200 mg/300mg/400 mg/m   
- Viral serologies – EBV, CMV, HSV, varicella, HBsAg, Anti HBs Ab, Anti HCV, HIV Ag and Ab.  


## Murphy staging system 
Pediatric NHL is staged according to the Murphy staging system, as follows:

**Stage I** – A single nodal area or a single extranodal tumor, excluding the abdomen and mediastinum.
Features of stage II to IV disease described below must be absent.

**Stage II** – Any of the following:
-	A single extranodal area plus regional lymph nodes
-	Two single extranodal tumors on the same side of the diaphragm, with or without regional lymph nodes
-	Primary gastrointestinal tumor (completely resected), with or without mesenteric lymph nodes

**Stage III** – Any of the following:
-	Primary intrathoracic (mediastinal, thymic, pleural) disease
-	Two extranodal sites on opposite sides of the diaphragm
-	Extensive primary intra-abdominal disease
-	Two or more nodal areas on opposite sides of the diaphragm
-	Any paraspinal or epidural tumors
Stage IV – Any of the above with involvement of bone marrow, central nervous system, or both.


## STAGING FOR TREATMENT
### GROUP A (low risk): 
Eligible patients are those with newly diagnosed, de novo mature B-cell lymphoma, including:
-	Burkitt lymphoma
-	Burkitt-like lymphoma
-	Burkitt leukemia (historically referred to as “Burkitt ALL”)
-	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
Patients with relapsed or refractory disease, transformed lymphoma, or lymphoma evolving from an indolent precursor (e.g., follicular lymphoma) are not eligible
The criteria are:
-	All resected stage I and Abdominal stage II only

### GROUP B (intermediate risk): 
Eligible patients are those with newly diagnosed, de novo mature B-cell lymphoma, including:
-	Burkitt lymphoma
-	Burkitt-like lymphoma
-	Burkitt leukemia (historically referred to as “Burkitt ALL”)
-	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
Patients with relapsed or refractory disease, transformed lymphoma, or lymphoma evolving from an indolent precursor (e.g., follicular lymphoma) are not eligible
The criteria are:
- Non resected Stage I and II OR 
- All stage III OR
- Stage IV (with blast < 25%) and no CNS involvement
Caution: Assessment of response to COP induction by PET‐CT or CT scan or MRI or BM or CSF examination. If no response (<20% shrinkage or tumour reduction – see below), move to Group C high risk.

### GROUP C (high risk): 
Eligible patients are those with newly diagnosed, de novo mature B-cell lymphoma, including:
-	Burkitt lymphoma
-	Burkitt-like lymphoma
-	Burkitt leukemia (historically referred to as “Burkitt ALL”)
-	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
Patients with relapsed or refractory disease, transformed lymphoma, or lymphoma evolving from an indolent precursor (e.g., follicular lymphoma) are not eligible
The criteria are:
-	Stage IV (with blast ≥ 25%) OR
-	CNS involvement – CSF WBC > 5 or cranial nerve deficit or brain mass or intraspinal mass. CNS positive cases have additional IT and chemotherapy

### OTHER CONSIDERATION 
1.	Stage II abdominal disease may be associated with involved local lymph node but to be eligible for treatment in group A, these involved lymph node MUST be completely resected and adjacent lymph node must be proven to be histologically free of tumour, otherwise patient should be treated in group B. 
2.	Paraspinal and epidural tumours are assigned Stage III. Patients with significant intra spinal extension (even without positive CSF cytospin) are treated as Group C. Cranial nerve involvement or extradural brain tumours are classified as CNS involved.
3.	Lymphomas of head and neck with intracranial extension as also treated as Group C i.e., CNS involved.

## RESPONSE CRITERIA
Complete response: 
- Complete disappearance of all measurable or evaluable lesions (except bone) on PET-CT scan, no L3 blasts in BM or in CSF.  

Incomplete response: 
- 20-99% reduction in the product of the 2 largest diameters of measurable lesions (as long as no regrowth occurred after 8 days after earlier shrinkage) and in the case of leukaemia 
- 20-99% reduction in number of L3 blasts by morphology or flow in BM and/or CSF 

Non-response: 
- < 20% tumour reduction of the product of the 2 largest diameters of measurable lesions or 
- <20% reduction in number of L3 blasts by morphology or flow in BM and/or CSF or tumour progression or tumour regrowth after initial shrinkage

## PROTOCOL FOR GROUP C HIGH RISK
Patients with bulky disease are at risk from metabolic complications secondary to tumour lysis syndrome. Vigorous measures should be taken to minimise the risk of this. Intravenous hydration fluids should be given prior to chemotherapy. Monitor fluid balance and continue hydration fluids after the administration of COP for as long as the risk of tumour lysis persists.
In a critical metabolic situation with impaired renal function (or very bulky disease) it may be advisable to give consecutive prednis(ol)one, vincristine then cyclophosphamide at 12 hrly intervals.
