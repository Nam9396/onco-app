# Protocols for the Treatment of Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Vietnam

## Diagnosis

### Clinical presentation 

The clinical manifestations of leukemia are a direct result of marrow invasion with resultant cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or neutropenia) and rarely extramedullary involvement. Children typically present with nonspecific symptoms related to anemia such as fatigue, irritability, and anorexia as well as clinical signs such as pallor, tachycardia, and more rarely evidence of congestive heart failure. Low-grade fever of unknown etiology may be a presenting manifestation due to presumed cytokine release or may be related to infection secondary to neutropenia and immunosuppression. Bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia is usually mild and manifests as petechiae, bruising, gingival oozing, or epistaxis. Life-threatening hemorrhage may occur but is very rare. Bone pain (typically long bones) is common and may result in refusal to walk or irritability in young children. This may result from direct leukemic infiltration of the periosteum or expansion of the marrow cavity by leukemic cells. Pathologic fractures may also be present at diagnosis and cause significant pain. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are common due to leukemic infiltration. 
Patients with T-cell ALL present with some distinctive features. It more frequently occurs in males, and the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at diagnosis is higher than for B-cell ALL (10% to 15% vs. 2% to 5%). Patients are more likely to present with a mediastinal mass (nearly 50%) or a white blood cell (WBC) count above 100,000 cells/µL (30% to 50%). The presence of an anterior mediastinal mass may cause airway or cardiovascular compromise. Frequently seen laboratory abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Evidence of tumor lysis related to a large tumor burden and rapid cell turnover may result in hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia (with resultant hypocalcemia due to precipitation of calcium phosphate). CNS involvement is usually detected in an asymptomatic child with analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Rarely, a patient may present with signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (i.e., cranial nerve VI palsy with resultant esotropia and diplopia, papilledema, visual changes, morning headache, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, possible seizures) or evidence of parenchymal involvement, hypothalamic syndrome, or diabetes insipidus. Other rare complications such as chloromas causing compression of the spinal cord or CNS hemorrhage (related to leukostasis and coagulopathy) are rare and more likely to be associated with AML. Leukemic involvement of the testes occurs in 2% to 5% of boys at diagnosis and presents as painless enlargement, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Early testicular involvement is also associated with T-cell disease, elevated WBC count, and lymphomatous features. 

### Diagnostic evaluation 

Children presenting with more than one cytopenia and clinical symptomatology suggestive of bone marrow infiltration should undergo a diagnostic evaluation to investigate for the possibility of acute leukemia. Laboratory and imaging studies indicated are: 

- Full blood count, differential, review of peripheral blood smear by an experienced individual 
- Bone marrow aspirate (consider biopsy for dry tap or inadequate specimen) for morphology, blast count, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, cytochemistry (as available) 
- Metabolic panel, to include liver function studies, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, (LDH), uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine 
- Blood culture if febrile; cultures of other suspected sites of infection 
- Chest radiograph to evaluate for the presence of a mediastinal mass 
- Plain films of the long bones for patients presenting with pain to evaluate for pathologic fracture or evidence of leukemic changes. 

Typically, the bone marrow is 80% to 100% replaced with lymphoblasts at diagnosis. At times, due to the packed condition of the marrow, it may be difficult to aspirate a sample (dry tap) and a bone marrow biopsy may provide diagnostic samples. The diagnosis of acute leukemia requires the presence of 25% or more blasts (M3 bone marrow); however, the diagnosis is suspected when the marrow contains more than 5% (M2 bone marrow, 5% to 25% blasts, with M1 being a normal bone marrow with 100,000 cells/µL is desired to decrease this risk but may be difficult to routinely achieve in our setting. In addition, evidence exists that a traumatic tap at diagnosis (with peripheral blasts) can theoretically seed the CSF space increasing the risk of later CNS relapse. Subsequent procedures may be done with platelet counts of 20,000 to 50,000 cells/µL, per provider preference and based on ease/availability of platelets for transfusion. A cell count and cytocentrifuge examination for cell morphology is done on the fresh CSF. 

The diagnosis of CNS leukemia requires the presence of 5 or more WBCs/µL and identification of blasts on the CSF cytocentrifuge examination. CNS leukemia is classified as follows:

- CNS1: no detectable blasts
- CNS2: < 5 WBCs/uL, blasts present
- CNS3: >= 5 WBCs /µL and blasts present or signs of CNS leukemia (i.e., facial nerve palsy, hypothalamic syndrome, or brain/eye involvement). 
    
A traumatic lumbar puncture is defined as the presence of ≥10 red blood cells/µL. Formulas are available to assist with interpretation of CNS status in the event of traumatic initial taps with blasts on cytospin (Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm).

### Clinical Staging 

Clinical staging is based on multiple factors including patient age, presenting WBC count, and underlying immunophenotype (T- vs. B-cell ALL). Average-risk patients must have the following: 

1. B-cell ALL 
2. Age between 1 and 10 years 
3. WBC < 50,000 cells/µL at presentation
4. CNS1/2
5. M1 marrow at day 29
6. No negative cytogenetic risk factors (only once these are being routinely determined) (i.e., hypodiploid, KMT2A, Ph- or Ph-like mutation, iAMP21, IKZF1)

All other patients will be classified as high-risk 

Marrow response has also been shown in multiple studies to be an important prognostic marker. Validation of multiparametric flow cytometric minimal residual disease (MRD) is necessary and required before utilizing this as a standard risk-stratification tool. Additionally, a PCR-based MRD testing methodology is the preferred method in the international and multi-center setting. 

Initially all new patients will be treated with the average risk protocol at this time until further information is available regarding the toxicity of therapy. 

## Treatment Plan 

All patients should be started on allopurinol 400 mg/m2/div three times daily 24 hours prior to chemotherapy in addition to normal saline fluids at 125 mL/m2/hour and continued for a minimum of 5 days. Children that are severely malnourished will likely not tolerate this fluid rate and should be given 75 mL/m2/hour and monitored closely. Patients should be monitored for tumor lysis with urea and electrolytes as well as uric acid, calcium, and phosphorus every 12-24 hours depending on initial white blood cell count and tumor bulk (based on degree of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly). Patients with significant increased risk of tumor lysis (i.e, mediastinal mass, bulky lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly, WBC >200 x 109/L) should receive steroids prior to the initiation of protocol therapy to reduce risk from cellular breakdown products. 

Patients with testicular disease at diagnosis should be monitored clinically and with ultrasound. Those patients that have not had resolution of their disease by the end of induction should receive testicular irradiation, 2400 cGy (200 cGy fractions over 12 days), during consolidation. 

Patients with central nervous system leukemia (i.e., CNS3) should receive cranial radiation to a total of 18 Gy (10 fractions of 180 cGy) in consolidation or at the beginning of maintenance therapy if unable to be done in consolidation. Patients will otherwise not receive prophylactic radiation therapy at this time. 

Average risk patients should be treated per the standard arm of COG AALL0932/CCG1991 with these additional caveats:

1. Patients who are CNS2 should receive additional IT MTX at day 15 and day 22 of induction 
2. All patients should receive 2 years of maintenance (from the start of interim maintenance 1)
3. Patients with a M2/M3 repeat bone marrow at the end of induction should be augmented to the high-risk protocol once there is enough safety data to ensure no increased toxicity on the average risk regimen. Prior to this time, all patients, no matter the repeat bone marrow results, should continue on the average risk protocol

Initially all new patients will be treated with the average risk protocol at this time until further information is available regarding the toxicity of therapy. 

When it is deemed safe and feasible to augment therapy, T-cell and high-risk pre-B ALL patients should be treated as below: T-cell patients should be treated per the standard arm of COG AALL0232 with these additional caveats: 

1. Patients who are CNS2 should receive additional IT MTX at day 15 and day 22 of induction 
2. All patients should receive 2 years of maintenance (from the start of interim maintenance 1) 
3. Patients should have a repeat bone marrow at the end of consolidation rather than the end of induction 
4. All patients who are determined to require radiation therapy should ideally receive this in consolidation (currently limited to CNS3 patients) 
5. Consideration for omitting 6MP during delayed intensification secondary to high infection risk during this cycle of therapy as well as potential genetic polymorphisms impacting 6MP metabolism until able to regularly obtain TPMT and NUDT15 results 
6. Patients should receive a single interim maintenance phase only (IM 1 only)

High-risk pre-B-ALL patients should be treated per the standard arm of COG AALL0232 with these additional caveats:

1. Patients who are CNS2 should receive additional IT MTX at day 15 and day 22 of induction 
2. All patients should receive 2 years of maintenance (from the start of interim maintenance 1) 
3. Patients should receive Capizzi methotrexate during both interim maintenance 1 and interim maintenance 2 
4. Consideration for omitting 6MP during delayed intensification secondary to high infection risk during this cycle of therapy as well as potential genetic polymorphisms impacting 6MP metabolism until able to regularly obtain TPMT and NUDT15 results
