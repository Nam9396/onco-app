## MAINTENANCE: HIGH RISK ALL 

This therapy is for all patients with High Risk B-ALL and T-ALL (post Induction)

Maintenance begins on Day 57 of DI (for T-ALL) and IM II (for HR pre-B-ALL) or when peripheral counts recover to ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75000/µL (whichever occurs later) for Cycle 1. For subsequent cycles, follow dose modifications for low counts and platelets. Maintenance consists of 12 week cycles repeated until total duration of therapy is 2 years from the start of Interim Maintenance I (for all patients). This Therapy Delivery Map is on one (1) page.
